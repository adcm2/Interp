# Interp


c++ header-only template library for iterpolation. Linear algebra done using Eigen3. 

Cubic splines interpolation done using natural boundary conditions, ie that the second derivative is zero at the start and end points. 
Checks performed:
1. Linear function y = x, all results were as expected.
